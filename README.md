## Description
This is a simple workout tracking app.  This application uses a Mongo database.  I require the Mongoose node.js package to create a Mongoose schema.  Express is also required to handle the routes.  Users are able to select the type of exercise they would like to perform: “cardio or resistance.”  After the selection is made, users are presented with an input form to enter specific exercise they would like to do.  Users are also able to input preferences for: “distance, weight, reps, sets, and duration.  This information is stored into a mongoDB so it can be used to create the Workout Dashboard.  On this page users are able to see their cumulative stats for the workouts they have performed over the week.  My mongoose schema is able to track each DB entry by the current date and time. 

## Installation
This app is deployed on Heroku and uses a MongoDB with a Mongoose schema.

## Usage
Deploy app and follow the user inputs.
